1. Full Binary Tree -> Every Node has either 0 or 2 children.

2. Complete Binary Tree -> a) all the levels are completely filled except the last level.
                           b) the last level has all nodes on left as possible.
                          
3. Perfect Binary Tree -> All leaf nodes are at same level.

4. Balanced Binary Tree -> Height of tree can be at max log(N).
                           where N -> no of nodes.

5. Degenerate Tree -> Every node has a single child.
