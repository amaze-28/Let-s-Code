Binary Trees -> Binary Tree is defined as a tree data structure where each node has at most 2 children. 
                Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child.
								
Root -> The topmost node in the tree is called the root.

Interior Nodes -> Nodes with children are called interior nodes.

Leaf Nodes -> Nodes without children are called leaf nodes.

Ancestors -> The ancestor of a node in a binary tree is a node that is at the upper level of the given node.
